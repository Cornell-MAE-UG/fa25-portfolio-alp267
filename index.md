## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/IMG_0392.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a sophomore Biomedical Engineering student at Cornell University. I am a member of the Cornell Varsity softball team, which takes up the majority of my time, however, I am very interested in getting more experiences with biomechanics and analysis of biomechanics data in athletic settings.

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.

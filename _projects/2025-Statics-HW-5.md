Choosen Accuator: IMA55 RN05

Goal: Maximize the height that our system can lift a weight


Geometry:

Pin A Coordinates: (0,0)

Pin B Coordinates: (120.00 cm,0)

Bar: 50.00 cm

Starting Angle (θ): 29.3°

Ending Angle (θ): 85°


Accuator Info:

Peak Thrust: 35.81 kN

Base length: 80.21 cm

Extended: 125.91 cm

The stroke is 45.70 cm (extended length - base length) which is within the limits of the accuator chosen. Now that we have our setup and appropriate information and geometry, we can now calculate what the maximum height we can lift our unknown weight to is...

Initial Height = (50.00 cm)*(sin(29.3)) = 24.46 cm

Final Height = (50.00 cm)*(sin(85)) = 49.81 cm

My goal was to maximize the final height of the weight. Since we are limited to a 150.00 cm x 50.00 cm space, lifting the weight to 49.81 cm accomplishes this goal. The vertical distance traveled by the weight is 25.35 cm. If I were to run this calculation again, I may attempt to maximize the distance traveled by the weight, not just the final height. To see the maximum weight that my accuator could now carry, we will use mechsanical advantage calculations alongside the peak thrust.

MA = 0.839

Maximum Weight = (0.839)(35.81 kN) = 30.04 kN

In conclusion, my accuator + rigid bar design is able to list a 30.04 kN weight 25.35 cm to reach a maximum height of 49.81 cm.

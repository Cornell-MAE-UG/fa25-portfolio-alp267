## ENGRD 2020 Updated Portfolio: Mechanism Including an Actuator ##
The goal of this mechanism is to maximize the height that our machine/system can lift a weight
using a linear actuator, within a fixed space of 150 cm by 50 cm. The system is made up of two
ground-mounted pinned supports at points A and B, a rigid lifting bar, and a single rod-type
actuator. Everything is assumed to be rigid.

**Design Objectives:**
●Maximize vertical lift height (h)
●Maximize the allowable lifting weight (not my main goal)

**Constraints:**
● 150 cm x 50 cm space
● Peak actuator thrust: 35.81 kN
● Pin A Coordinates: (0,0)
● Pin B Coordinates: (120.00 cm,0)
● Bar Length: 50 cm

**Analysis:**
We will treat the bar as a rigid body and the actuator will produce a vertical lifting reaction.
Wmax = Factuatorsin(Θ) 
Factuator = 35.81 kN
Θ = tan-1(bar/distance between pins) = tan-1(0.5m/1.2m) = 22.62o
Wmax = (35.81 kN)*sin(22.62) = 13.77 kN
Therefore, the upper bound load of the rigid-body is approximately 13.77 kN.

**Step 2:**
Now we are going to treat the bar as a beam instead of a perfectly rigid bar. It will deflect due to
the payload weight and the actuator induced transverse load.

**Assumptions:**
●Small deflections
●Transverse loading only
●Simply supported between A-B
●Point load at distance 4.35 cm (or at the tip of the 50 cm bar)
●Material & Properties: Steel → E = 200 GPA

**Analysis:**
Find the max deflection based on the above information:
δmax = Wb3/48EI
W = 13.77 kN and the rectangular cross section has a width of 20 mm and a height of 40 mm.
I = bh3/12 = (0.020 m)(0.040 M)3/12 = 1.07x10-7 m4
δmax = (13.77 kN)(0.020 m)3/48(200x109 Pa)(1.07x10-7 m4) = 0.000107 mm

This works with the restrictions (I think, I’m tired 🙂)
